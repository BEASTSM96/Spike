# LightEngine

Cross platform Application Engine written in C++. Can also be used as a powerful Game Engine. Its Under Development right now.<br/>

## Project Setup :wrench:

- This Project uses `Premake` as its build system<br/>

- Visual Studio 2019 is recommended<br/>

- You need to install `git` on your device to start working with this project. Follow [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download `git`. Git should be on your command line. Type `git clone --recursive https://github.com/FahimFuad/LightEngine#lightengine` on the command line, if you want to clone along with the submodules ( submodules are needed to run the engine) or if you already cloned the project type `git submodule init` on the command line of your project directory, then type `git submodule update` to update and clone the submodules in their respective directories. Then you can use different commands for the `premake` to generate the project files. Go to [this link](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Using-Premake) for a full list of actions. Then premake will generate your project files :smiley:<br/>
- You can also use any git gui such as `Github Desktop, Git Kraken etc.`<br/>

- You can now run the solution (On visual studio) and get the engine up and running<br/>
